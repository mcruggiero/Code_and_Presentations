TOSCA engineers rely on Excel sheets to construct test cases for applications and websites. However, these sheets are often \textbf{poorly stored, inconsistently formatted, and difficult to search through}. Engineers spend excessive time locating the relevant sheets and extracting useful information. \newline

\par Even when the appropriate sheets are found, the \textbf{test steps provided are frequently vague, incomplete, or not actionable}. Engineers are often required to manually reach out to the original authors or last editors to clarify missing details, introducing further delays in the test creation process. \newline

\par Compounding these inefficiencies, \textbf{there is no structured database} to store and index these test cases. Instead, engineers must manually search through an ever-growing collection of spreadsheets, resulting in wasted time and inconsistent test quality. \newline

\par To address these challenges, we propose an \textbf{automated agent} that will \textbf{clean, compile, compare, and coordinate} test case data. This system will work along side engineers to retrieve relevant Excel sheets based on their test case description, extract and refine actionable steps, and identify key contacts for further clarificationsâ€”thereby significantly reducing the time required to generate high-quality test cases. \newline
