### Project objective and process

The objective of the project is to provide the most up to date information about road incidents. This information becomes especially critical in emergency situations. 

Twitter and Google maps are a power couple  capable of delivering the information we need. Whereas, Twitter has indisputably become a source of most up to date  information, Google maps have the most comprehensive coverage of all roads worldwide. 
The API's of both have been leverage upon to build our solution. 
Twitter's API allows queries about specific location along with key search words (e.g. road closed, delay, etc.)

Example: 
In[]: place_ld:'unique identifier' road closed
Out[]: running late road M16 closed. 

On the other hand, Google maps's, with a simple API query, provides information about the distance, travel time and alternative  routes between any origin and destination. 
Our solution leverages on both APIs by identifying a link between the closed road mentioned in the Twitter account and the proposed (alternative) route suggested by Google maps. 

If we assume that at  the fire fighters are called for an evacuation mission, as they check for the fastest/safest route toward their destination, the road flagged by Twitter will show in the Google map query in red( signaling a non advisable route) and will show the corresponding tweet. The second fastest route will be suggested (in bold).  Other clear routes will also show in green color.
